1. what's soundtracker?
soundtracker (not going to be the final name!) is a tool for creating 8-bit chiptunes
using the basis of trackers.
Unlike similar 8-bit trackers, this tracker is designed to be more IT-friendly.

3. user interface

3.1.

3.2. pattern view
use left and right to move the cursor
use up and down to scroll between rows
use the keyboard like a piano to put a note (volume and instrument values are also set)
you can set the current effect by going there
NOTE|INSTRUMENT|VOLUME|EFFECT
... .. ... ... -> C-5 01 v40 G00

3.3. instrument view
(I'll write more later)
-INSXX^v: current instrument to be edited
-Save: saves this instrument
-Load: load an instrument
-RelNote: sets relative note for this instrument
-Name: sets the name of this instrument (max 32 chars)
-Filter: sets the filter mode for this channel (won't be active if cutoff envelope is not active)



(Sequence Editor)
-ON/NO: toggles if this envelope will be used
-SeqXX^v: sets the sequence to be used
-NF: finds the next free envelope and assigns it to this instrument
-X: clears the current envelope (no warnings!)
-Loop: loop point for this sequence
-Release: release point for this sequence
-Length: length of this sequence

4.1. keyboard reference

4.2. effect reference
The effect set used by soundtracker is the same used in Impulse Tracker.
[effect] [action]
  Axx    Sets the speed to XX. Effect is ignored if A00.
  Bxx    Jumps to pattern XX.
  Cxx    Pattern break. Jumps to next pattern at position XX.
  Dxx    Volume slide. 0X for a down slide and X0 for a up slide.
  Exx    Pitch slide down.
  Fxx    Pitch slide up.
  Gxx    Tone portamento. XX is speed.
  Hxy    Vibrato.
  Ixy    Tremor.
  Jxy    Arpeggio.
  Kxx    Volume slide + Vibrato.
  Lxx    Volume slide + Tone Portamento.
  Mxx    Sets channel volume.
  Nxx    Channel volume slide.
  Oxx    Start all envelopes at position XX.
  Pxx    Panning slide. 0X for a right slide and X0 for a left slide.
  Qxy    Retriggers all envelopes.
  Rxy    Tremolo.
  Sxy    Special commands.
  Txx    Set tempo.
  Uxy    Fine vibrato.
  Vxx    Set master volume.
  Wxx    Master volume slide.
  Xxx    Set panning.
  Yxy    Panning tremolo.
  Zxx    Tracker command.

4.3. volume column reference

4.4. Zxx reference
*** NOTE: This is not implemented yet! ***
The Zxx effect allows controlling the chip's registers and some tracker variables directly.
Values from 00-7f change the current variable's value.
Values from 80-ff allow setting up the current variable.
[value] [action]
  $80   Do nothing.
  $81   Enable smooth value changes.
  $82   Disable smooth value changes.
$90-$97 Enable envelopes for this channel.
$98-$9f Disable envelopes for this channel.
$a0-$a7 Set filter mode for unfiltered notes on this channel.
$a8-$af Force filters on this channel.
  $b0   Cutoff handling.
  $b1   Resonance handling.
  $b2   Toggle forcing ring modulator.
  $b3   Ring modulator (note) handling.
  $b4   Ring modulator (sweep) handling.
  $b5   Ring modulator (relative note) handling.
  $b6   Ring modulator (multiplier) handling.
  $b7   Ring modulator pulse width handling.
$b8-$bf Set ring modulator shape.
  $c0   Pulse width handling.
  $c1   Pulse width (sweep) handling.
$c8-$cf Force a shape under non-shaped notes on this channel.
  $d0   Force ADSR volume on this channel.
  $d1   Force ADSR cutoff on this channel.
$d2-$d5 Volume ADSR parameter handling.
$d6-$d9 Cutoff ADSR parameter handling.
$e0-$e7 Toggle forcing another envelope on this channel.
$e8-$ef Forced envelope handling.
  $f0   Force oscillator.
  $f1   Force PCM sampler.
  $f2   Toggle forcing oscillator sync (self). Use RM parameters.
  $f3   Toggle forcing oscillator sync (send).
  $f4   Local mode for switches.
  $f5   Global mode for switches.
  $fb   Reset registers.
  $fc   Reset oscillator.
  $fd   Reset filter.
  $fe   Reset RM oscillator.
  $ff   Reset channel.

4.5. compatibility reference
-Gxx behavior:
 -IT: share Gxx memory with Exx and Fxx
 -original/PT/XM/S3M: don't share memory
-Exx/Fxx memory:
 -IT: there is E/F memory
 -original/PT/XM/S3M: nothing
-Arpeggios:
 -original/IT/PT/S3M: normal arpeggios
 -XM: reversed arpeggios, and unexpected behavior at speed>16
-Effect values:
 -original/IT/PT/XM: zero values don't use the previous effect's value
 -S3M: zero values use the previous effect's value
-Note range:
 -original/IT/XM/S3M: C-0 to B-9
 -PT: C-3 to B-6
-Retrigger with RVCT value 0:
 -original/IT/PT/S3M: no change
 -XM: previous value
-Tremor:
 -original/PT/S3M/XM: clean tremor
 -IT: buggy tremor
-Instrument without note:
 -original/S3M/XM: reset volume, nothing else
 -IT: retrigger note with new instrument
 -PT: change instrument but do not retrigger note
-Dxx memory:
 -PT: no Dxx memory
 -original/IT/S3M/XM: Dxx memory present

4.6. in-depth effect information
this is how soundtracker processes effects.
-Axx: Set Speed: sets the speed ONLY in the first tick.
-Bxx: Jump to Row: jumps to order XX after this row.
-Cxx: Jump to Next: jumps to next order after this row, starting at position XX.
-Dxx: Volume Slide: slides the volume either up or down per tick.
    -if 0x, then volume-=x; otherwise volume+=x
    -if Fx, then previous procedure applies only in the first tick
-Exx: Pitch Slide Down: slides the pitch down per tick.
    -if Ex, changes are 4 times more precise
    -if Fx, slide is only done in first tick
-Fxx: Pitch Slide Up: same as above but goes up.
-Gxx: Tone Portamento: slides to new note with speed xx.
    -if this effect is present do not reset envelopes.
-Hxy: Vibrato: executes a vibrato using a sine wave at speed X and depth Y.
    -original pitch is preserved, though.
-Ixy: Tremor: note on for X ticks, and off for Y ticks.
-Jxy: Arpeggio:
(i'll write more later)

4.7. chip's technical information
the chip emulated in the tracker is a custom chip. here's its description.
-8 channels
-2 modes per channel: OSCILLATOR, and PCM SAMPLES.
-filters (low, high and band) in all modes.
-ring modulation in ALL modes!
(i'll write more later, sorry)
